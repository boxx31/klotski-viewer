This is an interactive [3D graph](https://boxx31.github.io/klotski-viewer) of all possible positions in the standard Klotski puzzle.

You can:
- Fly around freely
- Trace your path on the graph as you play on the board
- Find the optimal shortest route between any two positions

Data and graph based on original [webpage](https://github.com/2swap/Klotski-Webpage) and [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGLNyHd2w10) by 2swap.
